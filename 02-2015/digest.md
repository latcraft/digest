# Tweets of the month
* **@estherderby** Being a "leader" is not synonymous with being "in charge." This confusion causes many problems. 
* **@kcshearon** When people realize values don't scale, why are the values assumed to be wrong? Maybe scale isn't everything.
* **@eduardsi** Applying "5 Whys" to "Life-Work Balance" leads to quitting a job.
* **@CurtisRCooley** Refactoring is like cleaning dog poop out of your yard. Focus on the areas you use the most. That old dried up pile in the corner can wait.
* **@gar1t** We can do better than Agile. I propose Awesome. No, Awesome Hard and Fast. Wait, On Time. On Time and Awesome. Ugh, naming methods is hard.
* **@gregyoung** for me micro services are just object oriented programming until someone wisely puts a concurrency model on them and they become actors.
* **@jnabrdalik** There, for all those who want to start talking at conferences: [tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8S0FDjFBj8o) :)
* **@gwenshap** Except there is one writer and many readers - so schema and validation must be done on ingest. Anywhere else is just shifting responsibility
* **@jaykreps** Startup style of engineering (fail fast & iterate) doesn't work for every domain, esp. databases & financial systems
* **@bpoetz** programming is awesome if you like feeling dumb and then eventually feeling less dumb but then feeling dumb about something else pretty soon
* **@Steve_Yegge** Saying you don't need debuggers because you have unit tests is like saying you don't need detectives because you have jails.
* **@timoreilly** Facebook is hacked 600,000 times a day. @futurecrimes First thing to do to protect yourself, turn on 2-factor authentication
* **@architectclippy**: I see you have a poorly structured monolith. Would you like me to convert it into a poorly structured set of microservices?
