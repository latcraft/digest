* **@raganwald**: Before you hire a consultant to improve your team's productivity, consider that dog trainers train the owners, not the dogs.
* **@abt_programming**: Leadership is the art of getting someone else to do something you want done because he wants to do it" - Dwight Eisenhower
* **@allspaw**: "The right tool for the job!" said someone whose assumptions, past experience, motivations, and definition of "job" aren't explicit.
* **@kgardnr**: Just for fun: Get hired as "Code Ninja". Don't show up the first day. When they say "We didn't see you at the office today." Say "Exactly."
