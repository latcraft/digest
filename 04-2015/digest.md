# Tweets of the month

* **@alazar**: They ask for "rock stars," but are all disappointed when you show up late and wasted.
* **@richardadalton**: Teams are immutable. Every time someone leaves, or joins, you have a new team, not a changed team.
* **@kevlinhenney**: Names that differ only in their affixes (e.g., I, Abstract, Impl, Base) are some of the most overlooked transgressions of the DRY principle.
* **@bitfield**: The more monitoring you have, the more trouble you find. If you don’t have monitoring, trouble finds you.
* **@leanvoices**: At work, everyone thinks they know what the problems are, few know the causes fewer know how to solve and fewer have courage to try.


# Book of the month
* [Lean Enterprise: How High Performance Organizations Innovate at Scale ](http://www.amazon.com/Lean-Enterprise-Performance-Organizations-Innovate/dp/1449368425) by **Jez Humble**, **Joanne Molesky** and **Barry O'Reilly**
